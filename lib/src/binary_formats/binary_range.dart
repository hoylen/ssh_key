/// Helper class for decoding binary data.
///
/// A binary range is a sequence of bytes to be decoded. A contiguous range from
/// the [bytes] is tracked by the [begin] and [end] indexes into it. As bytes
/// are processed, they are removed from the range by incrementing the _begin_
/// index.
///
/// The binary range maintains a reference to the bytes. It does not make a copy
/// of them. Therefore, the program should not modify the bytes until after the
/// binary range is no longer needed.

  /// If the _end_ offset is not specified, it is initialized to after the last
